Big Data Project

This project was completed through downloading and importing a large dataset from the internet, analyzing, cleaning, and creating models that would help predict the following daysâ€™ closing stock prices. Through feature engineering, cross validating, and creating hyperparameters for the data, we were able to create a relatively reliable model that could aid us in the prediction. The conclusion I was able to make is that it is very difficult to predict future results from the stock market, from past results. Much of the modeling we do, even with thorough testing, would not be verifiably able to predict with a considerable amount of accuracy.
